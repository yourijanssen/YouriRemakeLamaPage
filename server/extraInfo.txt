HTTP POST request
We use POST to create a new resource. A POST request requires a body in which you define the data of the entity to be created.
A successful POST request would be a 200 response code. 

HTTP GET request
We use GET to read or retrieve a resource. A successful GET returns a response containing the information you requested.

HTTP PUT request
We use PUT to modify a resource. PUT updates the entire resource with data that is passed in the body payload. 
If there is no resource that matches the request, it will create a new resource.

HTTP PATCH request
We use PATCH to modify a part of a resource. With PATCH, you only need to pass in the data that you want to update.

HTTP DELETE request
We use DELETE to delete a resource.
